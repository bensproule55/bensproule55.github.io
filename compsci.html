          <h2>Computer Science</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-desc">
            I am in second year computer science at University of Guelph. 
            I have primarily been working in C and Java, just recently starting 
            with more web-development. You can probably tell that I am less 
            into design from looking at this website. As I learn more about 
            I will update with some prettier stuff. Project-wise, I am unable 
            to upload school projects to anywhere on the web, but you are 
            welcome to view the source code for this site on my <a href="https://github.com/bensproule55">Github</a>.
